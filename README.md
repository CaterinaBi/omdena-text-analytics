# ðŸ“š Text analytics ðŸ“š

This repository will host a series of notebooks for text analytics learners. The main focus will be text pre-processing techniques, and EDA. 

The notebooks will be especially useful if you're taking part in one of my NLP challenges at the Omdena Cambridge Chapter, and you wish to learn text analytics, or simply up your EDA game.

Feel free to fork the repo and work on the notebooks locally!
